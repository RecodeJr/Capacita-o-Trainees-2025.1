# KanaTest (かな撤素闘)

A web-based game for practicing Japanese kana recognition by inputting their romaji pronunciation. Made for learning purposes (that goes both for you and for me lol)

## How to Play

1. Click "試練開始 / Game Start" to begin the quiz.
2. Type the romaji for each kana shown in the text field and press Enter.
3. At the end, you'll get a score out of 142, with an accompanying fanfare depending on your performance :).

### Refer to this chart for the romaji expected for each kana:
